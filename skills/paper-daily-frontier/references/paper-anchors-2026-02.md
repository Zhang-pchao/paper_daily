# Paper Anchors (from user-provided PDFs, 2026-02)

Use these anchors to guide relevance scoring and interpretation style.

## Anchor A — Deep JKO for nonlinear gradient flows
- Paper: Lee et al. (JCP, 2024) — Deep JKO
- Core signals:
  - time-implicit particle methods
  - Wasserstein/gradient-flow formulation
  - neural ODE + CNF density evaluation
  - nonlinear mobility, high-dimensional PDE solver

## Anchor B — Slow modes from static averages
- Paper: Devergne et al. (2025)
- Core signals:
  - slow dynamical modes
  - static-to-dynamics inference
  - mode decomposition / long-timescale behavior

## Anchor C — Solutal Marangoni in HER bubble dynamics
- Paper: Park et al. (Nature Chemistry, 2023)
- Core signals:
  - HER bubble coalescence/detachment
  - anion-specific effects (Hofmeister)
  - solutal Marangoni force and interfacial transport

## Anchor D — Electrolyte droplet spraying inside H2 bubbles
- Paper: Bashkatov et al. (Nature Communications, 2025)
- Core signals:
  - microbubble coalescence + Worthington jet fragmentation
  - droplet spraying in bubbles
  - thermocapillary/Marangoni-coupled internal flow
  - bubble departure/contact-line implications

## Anchor E — EDL at oxide-electrolyte interfaces
- Paper: Zhang et al. (Nature Communications, 2024)
- Core signals:
  - ab initio-based ML potentials with long-range electrostatics (DPLR)
  - pH-dependent surface charging
  - EDL microstructure (IHP/IMHP/OHP)
  - differential capacitance asymmetry and validation with experiments

## Practical scoring use

If a candidate paper strongly overlaps with any anchor’s core signals, boost relevance.

- Strong overlap with one anchor: +10 total-score bonus
- Strong overlap with two or more anchors: +18 total-score bonus
- Includes both method novelty and electrochemical-interface relevance: +25 total-score bonus
