# Personalized Research Push Profile (Zhang-pchao)

## Core field positioning

- Main track: Computational/Theoretical Chemistry
- Method backbone: Deep Potential MD / Neural Network Potentials / Enhanced Sampling
- Problem focus:
  1. Water self-ions (H3O+, OH-) at air-water and oil-water interfaces
  2. Proton transfer and tautomerism in solvated systems (e.g., glycine)
  3. Electric-field and interfacial modulation of reaction mechanisms and free-energy landscapes

## Priority sources

Tier A (must-have):
- ChemRxiv
- Journal alerts: JCTC, JCIM, JACS, Langmuir, JPCL, PCCP
- ACS / RSC / Wiley keyword alerts

Tier B (method expansion):
- arXiv: physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.soft, physics.bio-ph, physics.comp-ph

Tier C (supplement):
- Google Scholar alerts (keyword + author)
- Papers With Code (only when method novelty is clear)

## Default keyword pack (English)

## Query templates

1. "deep potential" AND ("air-water interface" OR "oil-water interface") AND (hydronium OR hydroxide)
2. ("neural network potential" OR "machine learning potential") AND ("proton transfer" OR tautomerism) AND water
3. ("enhanced sampling" AND glycine) AND (tautomerism OR proton transfer)
4. ("electric field" AND interface) AND ("reaction mechanism" OR "free energy")

## Ranking preference

Use total score (0-100):
- 35% chemistry relevance
- 30% method match
- 20% evidence quality
- 10% novelty signal
- 5% reproducibility signal

## Output preference

- Daily report language: English
- Daily shortlist size: 1 paper (only the most relevant one)
- Include a brief interpretation: background, method, and conclusion
- Use only essential metadata: title + paper link (no issue/volume by default)
- Add one-line notable-author context with institution + expertise + known method direction
- Add code/resource links only when available; otherwise omit this block
